# Badges

Generates badges for users of progrmming sites with ratings and their corresponding colours.

Badges available at https://rating-badges.herokuapp.com/site/username where <site> is one of Atcoder, Codeforces, or DMOJ.

E.g. https://rating-badges.herokuapp.com/DMOJ/crackersamdjam is ![badge](https://rating-badges.herokuapp.com/DMOJ/crackersamdjam).

Things to do:
- Add a rate limiter for DMOJ
- Display atcoder logo differently?
- What to do when cf is down? (which happens a lot)
